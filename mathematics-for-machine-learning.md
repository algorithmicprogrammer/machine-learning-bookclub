## Mathematics for Machine Learning

The SDML book club will start discussing *Mathematics for Machine Learning* (https://mml-book.github.io/)
by Deisenroth, Faisal, and Ong in November 2024.
The book website includes several resources, including a free PDF download of the book.
You can purchase the book from many retailers, including [here](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Machine-Learning-Peter-Deisenroth/dp/110845514X/ref=sr_1_1).
The plan is to meet twice per month starting in February, increasing from one chapter per month to two chapters per month.

### Notes and videos
Below are the notes/slides and meetup recordings.
All of the videos will be posted to the SDML YouTube channel:  [https://www.youtube.com/@SanDiegoMachineLearning/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@SanDiegoMachineLearning/videos)
